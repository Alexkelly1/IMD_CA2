                        <p>In the second year of my degree I was part of a group project. The objective of the project was to use Django to design a website that people would use.</p>
                        <p>We made an app, similar to Just Eat and Deliveroo where users could order food from a local grocery store or delicatessan. We used the programming language Python to develop the website along with Django.</p>
                        <p>Users could select a store or deli and select the items that they wanted from there with a pre-prepared list we generated in a database. We also used Stripe within the project so the users could finish off by 'paying' for their products.</p>

                        <h3>Fourth Year Project</h3>
                        <p>In my current, and final, year I am developing a Transport Helper application using React Native in Javascript.</p>
                        <p>A user can register for the application and then, once registered, login to the application.</p>
                        <p>Once registered/logged in users can save their frequently visited locations right to their account for ease of use. A naming convention consisting of a dropdown list including the likes of “Home”, “Work”, “School” etc and “Custom”. With “Custom”, once users choose this, they can name a location whatever they want.</p>
                        <p>Once a start location and an end location are entered by the user, the application will then provide multiple transport modes from A to B. These modes consist of Car, Bus, Bike, Luas, Train.</p>
                        <p>The application compares each transport mode on Travel Time, Cost, Environmental Scale, Fuel Consumption, Fuel Cost, and Parking.</p>
                        <p>Users are those with a mobile phone which is connected to mobile date, concerned about how they travel and what it does for the environment and their time.</p>

                <h1>Erasmus/Placement</h1>
                <p>As part of my Computing with a Language stream, I was required to complete a semester abroad as an Erasmus period rather than an internship like my peers</p>
                <p>I moved to Annecy, France on January 9th, 2022 and I returned to Ireland on June 15th, 2022.</p>
                <p>While in Annecy, I attened IUT Annecy which is the leading Technological Institution in the Rhone-Alpes region. My classes spanned from January until March with all of my modules centred around Data and Databases. I enjoyed the classes and made some really good friends.</p>
                <p>From March until June I was required to develop and deploy an application for a Humanitarian Arts Collective in Geneva. This was in place of the internship that my French peers had spent their first year getting into action. The application, which I developed using React Native in JavaScript, was designed to be similar to Instagram and Pintrest but for art and art lovers. Users could upload thier pieces of art whether it was drawings, paintings, or music.</p>
                <p>I passed all of my classes and my 'Internship' all while meeting new people and exploring France</p>
